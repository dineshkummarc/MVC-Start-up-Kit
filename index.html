        <h1>MVC Start-up Kit (jQuery version)</h1>

<p>Check branches for Library Agnostic version.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Basic JavaScript implementation of the classic MVC design pattern.</p>

<p>I found that full scale frameworks such as JavaScriptMVC, Backbone and Spine are great in the sense that they give you a lot of functionality, but I personally found them to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>really confusing (especially if you're trying to learn about MVC on the client-side)</li>
<li>force you to use a particular architecture that you're not used (and 'for me' the majority of the time feels very alien)</li>
</ul><p>So in typical programmer fashion, I decided to 'roll my own' (once I have this in a more stable state then I'll write up an article about it all).</p>

<p>I find this start-up kit gets me up and running very quickly utilising the MVC paradigm without loads of extra cruft I'm never going to use. But be aware that I had a very specific API design in mind when writing this library and so this might not necessarily work for every one.</p>

<p>There is lots to do with this project to get it to a stage where it's anywhere near production ready, but it was very interesting researching and building it.</p>

<h2>Goals/Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Very simple/logical folder structure (I don't like complicated set-ups)</li>
<li>Modular (built to comply with the AMD specification and uses RequireJs - if you're new to AMD or RequireJs then this post will help explain: <a href="https://github.com/Integralist/Blog-Posts/blob/master/Beginners-guide-to-AMD-and-RequireJs.md">Beginners Guide to AMD and RequireJs</a>)</li>
<li>Basic template engine.</li>
<li>Publisher/Subscriber event system.</li>
<li>Utilises Deferred/Promises for asynchronous tasks.</li>
<li>Easy to understand (I heavily comment my code, with the understanding that comments will be stripped at deployment via a 'build script'. See the RequireJs optimiser information in the above article link)</li>
<li>Tried to wrap certain implementations features so it becomes easier to swap out the implementation for your own or another library</li>
<li>Tried to keep a balance between static features/methods/properties (i.e. those that appear on all instances of a Controller) and instance specific features/methods/properties (this was so to help automate as much of the standard set-up as possible).</li>
<li>Two versions - one jQuery (as it makes this repo more appealing - I'm guessing - to jQuery users) and one which is library agnostic (I'm only using jQuery for: Simple PubSub + Deferred/Promises + basic event handling so is simple to swap out)</li>
</ul>
